            </div>
            <div class="Summary">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Aspiring software engineer with over 3 months experience in various languages such as Python,
                    Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Excellent at collaboration, problem-solving, and visual thinking.
                    An upbeat and motivated individual who believes in dedication, organisation, and going above and
                    beyond for the client. Ability to multitask, plan ahead and task manage with a keen eye for detail.
                    Clear communicator with enthusiastic style and approachable manner. Boasts a fierce technical
                    aptitude for cloud software programming and deployment.</p>
                <p>Ever since my early days in my science degree when I took a module or two in Java (making a
                    ball bounce across the screen) I have been fascinated by programming. Over the last few years I have
                    gained the confidence to dabble on freecodecamp and codeacademy to learn some bits and pieces of
                    HTML, CSS, and Python (culminating in a dice-rolling programme, because why roll your own for D&D
                    when python can do it for you).</p>
                <p>Throughout my dabbling in coding I have learned to basics of IDEs
                    such as Pycharm and Visual Studio Code along with frameworks like AWS and Django. I am also currently
                    undertaking a DfE skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering through HyperionDev in the evenings, with
                    my current grade sitting at 99%. Being accepted on a DfE skills bootcamp is showing me and reminding
                    me how much I love the elegance, problem-solving, and joy in the outcome of coding different projects.
                    It brings me so much joy completing something and showing off my hard work and perseverance.</p>
